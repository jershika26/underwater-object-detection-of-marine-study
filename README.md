Underwater Object Detection for Marine Studies
This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect and highlight underwater objects in images, which is useful for marine studies and environmental monitoring. The algorithm highlights non-water regions (objects) in green, helping researchers isolate and identify marine life, coral, or underwater structures from the water background.

Problem Statement
Detecting underwater objects such as marine life, coral reefs, or artificial structures in underwater imagery is a challenging task. The complexity arises from varying water colors, lighting conditions, and the presence of debris. Traditional methods are often computationally expensive or inaccurate. The goal of this project is to develop a more efficient solution that can automatically identify and highlight non-water objects in underwater images, providing a simple yet effective tool for researchers and marine biologists.

Use Cases
Marine Biology: Identifying and tracking marine life in underwater footage for research and conservation efforts.

Environmental Monitoring: Detecting and mapping coral reefs or artificial structures for ecological studies.

Underwater Robotics: Assisting underwater robots in object recognition for exploration or inspection tasks.

Underwater Photography: Enhancing object detection for underwater photographers or videographers by automatically highlighting points of interest.

Approach
Color Space Conversion: The image is converted from RGB to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space to facilitate easier detection of water regions, which typically fall within specific blue-green shades.

Water Region Detection: Using predefined HSV thresholds, water regions (blue-green hues) are identified and masked out, allowing non-water areas to be separated.

Object Highlighting: Non-water regions are highlighted in green using a binary mask, making them easy to identify and analyze. A black background is used to make the detected objects stand out.

Display Results: The script displays both the original image and the processed image side by side for easy comparison.

Conclusion
This project offers an efficient and straightforward approach to underwater object detection using OpenCV and Python. By leveraging color-based segmentation in the HSV space, it successfully isolates objects of interest in underwater environments, making it a valuable tool for marine biologists, environmental researchers, and underwater robotics. The algorithm can be easily customized to adjust detection sensitivity or object highlight colors, making it versatile for different types of underwater imagery.
